# Database Structure

I want to store my resolutions in a database.

A resolution must be some type of goal I want to achieve by next year

A goal consists of a title, description, a number that is worked towards, a goal has multiple records in a database (snapshot)

A snapshot contains a date and the value of what i had achieved at that point in time

A resolution could have a category, optional.


## Example

resolution = I want to lift 500 (kg) in total in the first working set for a certain exercise
snapshot (02/01/2026) 350 (kg)
